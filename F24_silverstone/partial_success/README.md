In this folder, you will find recordings in which the start up sequence was performed correctly, however the car went off track at some point on the track without completing a lap.\
practice1, 2, 3: The car stops moving during heading correction after overshooting despite command velocity still actively communicated via the API. This is likely due to the low command speed which is unable to overcome the car's inherent mechanical resistance (particularly whilst turning). To solve this, either increase speed, or implement an integral controller to increase speed when it "gets stuck" (the better solution).
